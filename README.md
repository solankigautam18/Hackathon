## Problem Statement

United Airlines strives to offer world-class customer service through its call center operations. However, the call center faces challenges in managing key performance metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). Inefficiencies in these areas result in increased operational costs and reduced customer satisfaction. 

The objective of this project is to analyze the existing call center data to identify the factors contributing to extended AHT and AST, and to propose a data-driven solution for optimizing call handling processes. This will lead to reduced call handling times, faster issue resolutions, and an overall improved customer experience.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves a comprehensive analysis of historical call data, call transcripts, and customer sentiment. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify call reasons, identify high-impact areas, and recommend improvements to the IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system.

### Key Steps in the Solution:
1. **Data Analysis**: Identify key drivers of long AHT and AST through feature analysis and correlation.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Use NLP models to categorize primary call reasons and predict potential AHT based on call features.
3. **IVR System Optimization**: Propose enhancements to the IVR system, such as adding new self-service options to resolve common issues without agent intervention.
4. **Quantification of Recommendations**: Measure the potential impact of proposed recommendations using metrics such as AHT reduction and percentage of self-serviced calls.

## Project Scenario
The project focuses on optimizing call center operations by providing actionable insights to United Airlines. The call center handles a variety of customer inquiries ranging from booking issues and flight changes to baggage inquiries and cancellations. By analyzing call data, we identified inefficiencies and proposed solutions to streamline call handling processes and improve overall service levels.

## Technology Stack
The following tools and frameworks were used to implement the solution:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, NLTK, SpaCy (for NLP tasks)
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Flowchart Creation**: Graphviz
- **Database**: SQL for querying and managing call center data
